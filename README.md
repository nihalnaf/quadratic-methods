# quadratic-methods
This project asks the user for a second-degree polynomial, and then it presents 5 options that it asks the user to select from. The options are calculating the roots, calculating the derivative equation, calculating the integral equation, solving for y given x, and solving for x given y. This is a very useful tool that I created for students that I tutor so that they can check their answers when practicing.
